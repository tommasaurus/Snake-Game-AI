# Snake-Game-AI

Snake Game with AI using Reinforcement Learning
Overview
This project is an implementation of the classic Snake game, enhanced with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that learns to play the game using reinforcement learning techniques. It includes a human-playable version of the game as well as an AI agent trained to maximize its score.

Files in the Project
agent.py: Defines the AI agent and its learning algorithms.
game.py: Core game logic for the snake game.
helper.py: Helper functions used across the project.
model.py: Neural network model used for the AI agent.
snake_game_human.py: Playable version of the game for human players.
How to Play
Human Players: Run snake_game_human.py to play the game manually.
AI Mode: The AI agent plays the game automatically when agent.py is executed.
AI and Reinforcement Learning
The AI agent uses a neural network to make decisions based on the game state.
Reinforcement learning is implemented to improve the agent's performance over time through rewards and penalties.
